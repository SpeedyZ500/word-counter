# Word Instance Counter
This is a simple project just used to , and individual word instances.
1. [X] Count the total number of words in a Book
2. [X] Track and output the total instances of each word for a book.
3. [X] Track for Chapter Level.
4. [X] Track for verse level.
4. [ ] (possibly) Count the total number of characters
5. [ ] (possibly) show the count of each character at each level
6. [ ] (someday) make it so that Multi-line chapter titles work, they do not work right now

Disclamer ensure all chapter and book titles are converted to single line titles before using, otherwise it will not process correctly, also won't process correcly if the first line is not a title, because it assumes that it is.
